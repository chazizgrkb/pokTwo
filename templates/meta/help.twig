        <span class="highlight">Q: What kind of videos can I upload?</span>

        <br>
        <br>A: You may upload any kind of personal video that you'd like to share with the world. We don't allow any nudity and your video must be appropriate for all audiences.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, this still leaves a lot of room for creativity!! Do you own a <a
            href="results.php?search=dog">dog</a> or a <a
            href="results.php?search=cat">cat</a>? Have you gone on vacationing in <a href="results.php?search=mexico">Mexico</a>? Do you live in
        <a href="results.php?search=netherlands">The Netherlands</a>?
        <br>
        <br>
        These are just some examples of the videos that our users are uploading. In the end, you know yourself best. What would
        <i>you</i> like to capture on video?

        <br><br><span class="highlight">Q: How long can my video be?</span>
